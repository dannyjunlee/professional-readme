## What Problem Does This Solve
  
This project solves the problem of having to create a new README file for every new project, which is not only time-consuming but can also lead to inconsistency and errors.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project comes from my inherent laziness. I wanted to develop something that can save me time in the long run.

## The Why

I built this project because I can use it for every new project I embark upon as a developer, and I feel it adequately tests the introductory content on Node.JS that we've learned in the Columbia Coding Bootcamp.

## Learning Outcomes

I learned through this project how to integrate NPM, create a file from scratch using JavaScript, and how to access functions from other JavaScript files, just to name a few.

## Contact Info
